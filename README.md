#### Class-01
 
##### Reading, Research, and Discussion

1. Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?
    * Running JS outside of a browser is helpful when creating CLI or back-end applications. 

2. What is the difference between a module and a package?
    * A module is a single file (or set of files within one import) that are utilized by the developer.
    * A package is a collection of modules. 

3. What does the node package manager do?
    * NPM is used publish, discover, install, and develop node programs. 
      * [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm.html)
    * It puts modules in place so that node can find them and so that dependency conflicts may be managed effectively.

4. Provide code snippets showing 3 different ways to export a function from a node module.

##### Reading, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development.
    * Writing code test-first requires you to develop more specific code with clearer aims
    * Reduction of time spent on reworking/refactoring
    * Ability to quickly identify errors and problems

2. In what case would you need to use `beforeEach()` or `afterEach()` in a test suite?
    * If the output of another test is interfering with the outcome of another, we can 'set up' the test environment with `beforeEach()` or 'tear down' the environment with `afterEach()`
      * [jestjs.io](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/setup-teardown)
 
3. What is one downside of  Test Driven Development?
    * Development feels slower in the beginning, since making tests upfront takes a lot of time and effort. 

4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
    * Constructors create Objects, and Prototypes amend/add to those Objects
    * Classes use constructors and methods to create Objects
      * [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

5. Name a use case for a static method.
    * When we need to implement functions that belong to the class, but not necessarily any particular object (instance) of it
    * For example, if we need a function to compare objects of a class, we need to create a static method within the class that targets the objects of that class
      * [js.info](https://javascript.info/static-properties-methods)

6. Write an example of a Higher Order function and describe the use case it solves.
![callback](assets/callback.png)
    * In the above example, `isEven()` is a higher-order function
    * Higher-order functions operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them (i.e. any function that takes a callback)
    * Higher-order functions allow us to create smaller, more readable functions to execute smaller pieces of logic (and then use those smaller functions in the higher-order functions)
      * [eloquent js](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html)

##### Vocabulary

* `higher-order function`
  * any function which operates on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them
    * [eloquent js](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html)

  * values of the properties attached to an object will not change over time
    * [stackexchange](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/235558/what-is-state-mutable-state-and-immutable-state)
* `object`
  * a container for properties/values and methods/actions
* `object-oriented programming (OOP)`
  * an approach to software development in which the data structure becomes an object which includes both properties and functions(methods)
  * allows us to create relationships between objects and for objects to inherit from one another
    * [webopedia](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/O/object_oriented_programming_OOP.html#:~:text=Object%2Doriented%20programming%20(OOP),applied%20to%20the%20data%20structure.)

* `instance`
  * one object of a given class OR
  * one `new Object()` created from a constructor

* `this`
  * the object that owns the code being executed currently
* `Test Driven Development (TDD)`
  * a style of programming characterized by writing a single unit test first, then writing just enough code to make the test pass, then refactoring for simplicity, then repeating, accumulating unit tests over time

* `Jest`
  * a javascript testing framework
    * [jestjs.io](jestjs.io)

##### Reading, Research, and Discussion

1. Why would a developer choose to make data models?
    * A well-done data model can make complex applications more scalable; gaining direct access to app infrastructure can make navigating changes more simple

2. What purpose do CRUD operations serve?
    * Allowing for persistent storage within applications/databases

3. What kind of database is Postgres? MongoDB?
    * Postgres is a relational database
    * MongoDB is a non-relational database
4. What is Mongoose and why do we need it?
    * Mongoose is an object modeling tool designed for use with MongoDB.

5. Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.
    * Table - a collection of related records within a database

##### Reading, Research, and Discussion

1. Give one strong argument for and against NoSQL Databases.
    * Pro: Flexible Data Models
      * NoSQL Databases easily store and combine any type of data, whether structured or unstructured. Schemas can be updated dynamically when needed without downtime or interruption
        * [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/scale/nosql-databases-pros-and-cons)
    * Con: Sacrificing referential integrity/data consistency for speed
      * With SQL Databases, we are bound by referential tables
      * With NoSQL Databases, we aren't imposing any logical consistency across tables by default; instead we need to build integrity mechanisms into the code
        * [quora](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-NoSQL-databases)
2. Name 3 cloud based NoSQL Databases
    * Amazon DynamoDB 
      * [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
    * Oracle 
      * [oracle](www.oracle.com)
    * MongoDB Atlas
