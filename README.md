##### Reading, Research, and Discussion

1. Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?
    * Running JS outside of a browser is helpful when creating CLI or back-end applications. 

2. What is the difference between a module and a package?
    * A module is a single file (or set of files within one import) that are utilized by the developer.
    * A package is a collection of modules. 

3. What does the node package manager do?
    * NPM is used publish, discover, install, and develop node programs. 
      * [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm.html)
    * It puts modules in place so that node can find them and so that dependency conflicts may be managed effectively.

4. Provide code snippets showing 3 different ways to export a function from a node module.

    * [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
* `package`
  * a collection of modules

  * a software registry used by developers and organizations to publish, install, and develop note programs
    * [NPM Docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm.html)

    * [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server)
* `environment`
  * anything installed on the machine where the app is being executed: inclyuding operating system, databases, environment variables, the compilers and interpreters being used, the local network, memory space available, etc.
    * [Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-programming-environment)
* `interpreter`

* `compiler`
  * converts an entire program into object code, which can then be directly executed as binary code
  * compiled languages include C and C++
  * Java programs are compiled to an intermediate form, then interpreted

##### Reading, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development.
    * Writing code test-first requires you to develop more specific code with clearer aims
    * Reduction of time spent on reworking/refactoring
    * Ability to quickly identify errors and problems

2. In what case would you need to use `beforeEach()` or `afterEach()` in a test suite?
    * If the output of another test is interfering with the outcome of another, we can 'set up' the test environment with `beforeEach()` or 'tear down' the environment with `afterEach()`
      * [jestjs.io](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/setup-teardown)
 
3. What is one downside of  Test Driven Development?
    * Development feels slower in the beginning, since making tests upfront takes a lot of time and effort. 

4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
    * Constructors create Objects, and Prototypes amend/add to those Objects
    * Classes use constructors and methods to create Objects
      * [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

5. Name a use case for a static method.
    * When we need to implement functions that belong to the class, but not necessarily any particular object (instance) of it
    * For example, if we need a function to compare objects of a class, we need to create a static method within the class that targets the objects of that class
      * [js.info](https://javascript.info/static-properties-methods)

6. Write an example of a Higher Order function and describe the use case it solves.
![callback](assets/callback.png)
    * In the above example, `isEven()` is a higher-order function
    * Higher-order functions operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them (i.e. any function that takes a callback)
    * Higher-order functions allow us to create smaller, more readable functions to execute smaller pieces of logic (and then use those smaller functions in the higher-order functions)
      * [eloquent js](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html)

##### Vocabulary

* `functional programming`
  * the process of building software using pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data,and side-effects
    * [medium](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0)
* `pure function`
  * a function which, given the same input, will always return the same output and produces no side effects
    * [medium](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-pure-function-d1c076bec976)
* `higher-order function`
  * any function which operates on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them
    * [eloquent js](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html)
* `immutable state`
  * values of the properties attached to an object will not change over time
    * [stackexchange](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/235558/what-is-state-mutable-state-and-immutable-state)
* `object`
  * a container for properties/values and methods/actions
* `object-oriented programming (OOP)`
  * an approach to software development in which the data structure becomes an object which includes both properties and functions(methods)
  * allows us to create relationships between objects and for objects to inherit from one another
    * [webopedia](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/O/object_oriented_programming_OOP.html#:~:text=Object%2Doriented%20programming%20(OOP),applied%20to%20the%20data%20structure.)
* `class`
  * functions which use constructors and methods to create objects
    * [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)
* `prototype`
  * a javascript property which allows us to add new properties or methods to object constructors
    * [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_prototypes.asp)
* `super`
  * the keyword used to access and call functions on an object's parent class
    * [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super)
* `inheritance`
  * private properties linking javascript objects from the highest parent object to its last child object
    * [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain)
* `constructor`
  * a method for creating and initializing an object of a given class
* `instance`
  * one object of a given class OR
  * one `new Object()` created from a constructor
* `context`
  * the value of `this` 
  * (think: 'in which object am i operating?')
* `this`
  * the object that owns the code being executed currently
* `Test Driven Development (TDD)`
  * a style of programming characterized by writing a single unit test first, then writing just enough code to make the test pass, then refactoring for simplicity, then repeating, accumulating unit tests over time
    * [agile alliance](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd)
* `Jest`
  * a javascript testing framework
    * [jestjs.io](jestjs.io)
* `Continuous Integration (CI)`
  * the process of merging all devs' working copies to a shared main branch repeatedly throughout the development process
* `unit test`
  * tests to check single parts of code to ensure that they run as expected & return an expected output
