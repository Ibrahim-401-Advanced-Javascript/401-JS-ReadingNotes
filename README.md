## 401 JavaScript Reading Notes


#### Class-01
 
##### Reading, Research, and Discussion

1. Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?
    * Running JS outside of a browser is helpful when creating CLI or back-end applications. 

2. What is the difference between a module and a package?
    * A module is a single file (or set of files within one import) that are utilized by the developer.
    * A package is a collection of modules. 

3. What does the node package manager do?
    * NPM is used publish, discover, install, and develop node programs. 
      * [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm.html)
    * It puts modules in place so that node can find them and so that dependency conflicts may be managed effectively.

4. Provide code snippets showing 3 different ways to export a function from a node module.

##### Reading, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development.
    * Writing code test-first requires you to develop more specific code with clearer aims
    * Reduction of time spent on reworking/refactoring
    * Ability to quickly identify errors and problems

2. In what case would you need to use `beforeEach()` or `afterEach()` in a test suite?
    * If the output of another test is interfering with the outcome of another, we can 'set up' the test environment with `beforeEach()` or 'tear down' the environment with `afterEach()`
      * [jestjs.io](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/setup-teardown)
 
3. What is one downside of  Test Driven Development?
    * Development feels slower in the beginning, since making tests upfront takes a lot of time and effort. 

4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
    * Constructors create Objects, and Prototypes amend/add to those Objects
    * Classes use constructors and methods to create Objects
      * [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

5. Name a use case for a static method.
    * When we need to implement functions that belong to the class, but not necessarily any particular object (instance) of it
    * For example, if we need a function to compare objects of a class, we need to create a static method within the class that targets the objects of that class
      * [js.info](https://javascript.info/static-properties-methods)

6. Write an example of a Higher Order function and describe the use case it solves.
![callback](assets/callback.png)
    * In the above example, `isEven()` is a higher-order function
    * Higher-order functions operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them (i.e. any function that takes a callback)
    * Higher-order functions allow us to create smaller, more readable functions to execute smaller pieces of logic (and then use those smaller functions in the higher-order functions)

  * an approach to software development in which the data structure becomes an object which includes both properties and functions(methods)
  * allows us to create relationships between objects and for objects to inherit from one another
    * [webopedia](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/O/object_oriented_programming_OOP.html#:~:text=Object%2Doriented%20programming%20(OOP),applied%20to%20the%20data%20structure.)

#### Class-04

##### Reading, Research, and Discussion

1. Give one strong argument for and against NoSQL Databases.
    * Pro: Flexible Data Models
      * NoSQL Databases easily store and combine any type of data, whether structured or unstructured. Schemas can be updated dynamically when needed without downtime or interruption
        * [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/scale/nosql-databases-pros-and-cons)
    * Con: Sacrificing referential integrity/data consistency for speed
      * With SQL Databases, we are bound by referential tables
      * With NoSQL Databases, we aren't imposing any logical consistency across tables by default; instead we need to build integrity mechanisms into the code
        * [quora](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-NoSQL-databases)
2. Name 3 cloud based NoSQL Databases
    * Amazon DynamoDB 
      * [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
    * Oracle 
      * [oracle](www.oracle.com)

##### Linked Lists

* When To Use Linked Lists
  * for tasks that require insert/delete.
  * when data storage space is limited
  * when the list may grow
   (size unknown at start)

* When to Use Arrays
  * for tasks that require searching
  * when data storage space is not a concern
  * when the list will not grow in size

* Singly linked lists contain nodes that store only two properties: 
  * the value of the contents of the node
  * a reference to the next node in the list

* Doubly linked lists contain nodes that store three properties:
  * the value of the node contents
  * the reference to the next node
  * a reference to the previous node. 

***

#### Class-06

##### HTTP and REST

* HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
  * Apps built using HTTP subscribe to the cient-server computing model
    * server = host designed to provide the service
    * client = hosts that make requests to the service
  * HTTP Requests
    * GET method -> retrieve a resource
    * HEAD -> retrieve headers
    * POST -> create a resource
    * PUT -> update a resource by replacing it
    * DELETE -> delete a resource
    * CONNECT -> create a TCP/IP tunnel (communicate between 2 networks)
    * OPTIONS -> returns supported methods for a URL
    * TRACE -> echos retrieved request (used for debugging)
    * PATCH -> modify specific parts of a resource
      * [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)
  * HTTP Response
    * First line contains HTTP Version (i.e. HTTP/1.1), Status Code (i.e. 200), and Status Message(i.e. 'OK')

* REST (Representational State Transfer)
  * REST Methods allow us to perform actions on data returned from RESTful API calls
    * CREATE -> Create a new record
      * like HTTP POST
    * READ -> Retrieve records
      * like HTTP GET
    * UPDATE
      * like HTTP PUT or PATCH
    * DELETE -> Remove a record

***

#### Class-07

##### Express MiddleWare

* Functions that requests are routed through
* Receive a request object, response object, and the next middleware function in the req/res cycle
  * if the function doesn't end the req/res cycle, it must call next() or the request will run for ever and ever and ever and ever and-
* order matters (a lot) when coding middleware functions
* application middleware handles:
  * errors
  * importing other routes
  * applying defaults
  * parsing
* route middleware handles:
  * logging
  * model loading
  * browser/location/user specific content
  * pre-rendering
* built-in middleware functions include:
  * express.static -> serves static assets such as HTML files, images, etc.
  * express.json -> parses incoming requests with JSON payloads
  * express.urlencoded -> parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads
  * [express](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html#middleware.built-in)
    
***

#### Class-08
 
##### Express Routing
* Router is essentially a mini express application
  * It provides us with routing APIs:
    * .use
    * .get
    * .param
    * route
  * Basic routes include simple page routing with callback functions
  * Route middleware includes functions we want to run before information is loaded to the user:
    * logging
    * pre-rendering
    * user authentication
  * Routes with parameters (i.e. '/route/:parameter') send or populate data that is specific to a parameter value
    * parameters are validated using .param()
* Route functions take two mandatory arguments: request, response
  * Request Objects can take parameters or query strings
  * Response Object is responsible for sending data back to the browser
    * sends status code
    * sends data objects

***

#### Class-09
 
##### Sub Documents in Mongoose
* Subdocuments are documents embedded in other documents; they come in two types:
  * arrays of subdocuments
  * arrays of subdocuments
* They enable us to nest schemas within other schemas 
* Nested schemas can have middleware, validation, and any other feature normally accessible to schemas
* However, subdocuments are not saved on their own; they are only saved whenever their parent document is saved
* [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/subdocs.html)

##### Joining Documents in Mongo
* Virtual Joins
  * `const Schema1 = new Schema({})`
  * `const Schema2 = new Schema({})`
  * `------`
  * `Schema2.virtual('items', { ref: 'Model1 }`
  * `------`
  * `const Model1 = mongoose.model('Model1', Schema1)`
  * `const Model2 = mongoose.model('Model2', Schema2)`
  * `------`
  * By making reference to the model we want to link our schema to, we can join them. 
* [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html#populate-virtuals]

***

#### Class-10

##### Stacks
* Stacks are structures that consist of nodes
* When referencing actions performed on stacks, we use the following terms:
  * Push -> items added into the stack are pushed (like arrays)
  * Pop -> items removed from the stack are popped (like arrays)
  * Top -> this is the top node in the stack
  * Peek -> peeking gives you the value of the top node in the stack
  * isEmpty -> returns true when the stack is empty, else returns false
* Stacks follow FILO and LIFO concepts
  * FILO -> first in/last out -> the first item added to the stack will be the last one popped out
  * LIFO -> last in/first out -> the last item added to the stack will be the first one popped out
  
##### Queues
* Queue Vocab
  * Enqueue -> Nodes that are added to the queue
  * Dequeue -> Nodes that are removed from the queue
  * Front -> The first Node of the queue
  * Rear -> The last Node of the queue
  * Peek -> gives you the value of the front Node in the queue
  * IsEmpty -> returns true when the queue is empty, else false
* Queues also follow FIFO and LILO concepts
  * FIFO -> first in first out -> first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue
  * LILO -> last in last out -> last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue
  
  ***

#### Class-11

##### Authentication
* Router Middleware
  * Middleware functions have access to the request object, response object, and the next middleware function in the web request-response cycle
  * Middleware functions can:
    * execute any code
    * make changes to the request and/or response objects
    * end the request-response cycle
    * call the next middleware function in the stack
  * Express apps can use:
    * application-level middleware - `app.httpmethod(function)` or `app.use(function)`
    * router-level middleware - `const router = express.Router` -> `router.use(function)` or `router.httpmethod(function)`
    * error-handling middleware - `app.use(function(err, req, res, next)`
      * takes four arguments; in addition to req, res, next, we add err
    * built-in middleware
      * `express.static` serves static assets such as HTML files and images
      * `express.json` parses requests with JSON payloads
      * `express.urlencoded` parses incoming requests with url-encoded payloads
    * third-party middleware
      * dependencies that we install with node which add specific functionalities to express applications
* Dynamic Module Loading
  * wrapping imports in async functions
  `async function loadPage() { await import('file/path/filename.js); code to run after completion of import goes here }`
    *[github](https://gist.github.com/Rich-Harris/ea561810900eedd2a8e9afbc78ddd566)
* Singleton Pattern
  * The Singleton Pattern involves a single class responsible for creating an object while ensuring that only a single object gets created
  * The object can be accessed directly without needing to instantiate the object class, as it has been automatically instantiated upon its creation
    * [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/singleton_pattern.htm)
* CRUD -> REST Method Matches
  * Create - POST
  * Read - GET
  * Update - PUT
  * Delete - DELETE
* Mock Testing
  * Mock functions allow us to test code by 'erasing' the actual implementation of the function, instead creating mock situations to base our code connection tests on.

#### Class-12
 
##### OAuth
* Why is authentication important?
  * Protecting a user's private or sensitive information
* Why should we be careful about storing users' passwords?
  * Data breaches occur often, and if we are not careful about the information we store along with encrypted passwords, we could be giving hints to how to easily decrypt them. 
* What is the difference between hashing and encryption?
  * Hashing is a one-way irreversible data conversion using alphanumeric characters to produce a new key, a complex string of letters and numbers
  * Encryption is a secure encoding technique in which data is encoded using an algorithm which only authorized personnel have access to
    * [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/encryption-encoding-hashing/)
