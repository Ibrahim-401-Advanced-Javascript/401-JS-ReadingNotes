##### React Native
* Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”
  * generally, reducers are defined in their own file, while their action creators are in a separate file. then, they are each defined in a third file and imported to both locations. the ducks system suggests putting all redux-related logic in one file.
* What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit
 
##### Vocabulary
* `redux toolkit slices`
  * each reducer that is passed into `combineReducers` is referred to as a 'slice'
* `namespace`
  * a set of names that are used to refer to different reducers or reducer-related functions
  * ensures that each has a unique name so that their actions will not be duplicated unintentionally

##### Ethics

I read:
* [Amazon Workers Demand Jeff Bezos Cancel Face Recognition Contracts With Law Enforcement](https://gizmodo.com/amazon-workers-demand-jeff-bezos-cancel-face-recognitio-1827037509)
* [Google Backtracks, Says Its AI Will Not Be Used for Weapons or Surveillance](https://gizmodo.com/in-reversal-google-says-its-ai-will-not-be-used-for-we-1826649327)
* [Microsoft Employees Protest Work With ICE, as Tech Industry Mobilizes Over Immigration](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/technology/tech-companies-immigration-border.html)

In 2018, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all faced some heat from employees as well as outside spectators for providing services to agencies whose ethics are questionable at best. For example, Amazon was criticized for marketing its facial recognition software to law enforcement and other government agencies as well as having ties to Palantir, the company who provides predictive policing tools to law enforcement and ICE. Microsoft had a cloud computing contract with ICE and an AI contract with the Pentagon. Google was involved in a Pentagon program which used AI to analyze drone footage, but they responded to backlash by changing their AI principles and committing to not use AI for weapons or surveillance.

Ultimately I agree with the employees who wrote letters calling on their employers to terminate these contracts. At the end of the day, the question of ethics is not "can they," but rather, "should they?" As technology becomes more ingrained to our daily lives, and as technology advances, the power technology has over us increases. In my opinion, while a company is free to do whatever its board deems it can, it is the responsibility of the companies who develop these technologies to distribute them in a way that prioritizes people over profit. 

It is also deeply frustrating to have to face the dilemma, as an employee, of whether to maintain employment with a tech company due to its unethical practices. For example, I have no interest in developing technology for a company who is willing to sell that technology, and, in the process, the lives of its consumers, to the military, police, or any other government agency for that matter.

Quotes that stuck out to me:
* “Our company [Amazon] should not be in the surveillance business; we should not be in the policing business; we should not be in the business of supporting those who monitor and oppress marginalized populations.”
* “We believe that Microsoft must take an ethical stand, and put children and families above profits... As the people who build the technologies that Microsoft profits from, we refuse to be complicit.”

##### Open Source Software Contribution

I was happy to see all the resources for open-source projects, specifically the 'first-timers-only' tag. I feel very intimidated by the idea of contributing to open-source projects, mostly because I don't have much practice developing outside of the scope of the projects we've created in class or for finals/midterms. Knowing that there is a place specifically aimed toward me and others like me is very comforting. It makes me feel less scared that I'll start something and not have the skill needed to have it merged.

My group is considering issues from [this repo](https://github.com/codeezzi/utility/issues) for the Open-Source lab.
