##### React Native
* Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”
  * generally, reducers are defined in their own file, while their action creators are in a separate file. then, they are each defined in a third file and imported to both locations. the ducks system suggests putting all redux-related logic in one file.
* What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit
 
##### Vocabulary
* `redux toolkit slices`
  * each reducer that is passed into `combineReducers` is referred to as a 'slice'
* `namespace`
  * a set of names that are used to refer to different reducers or reducer-related functions
  * ensures that each has a unique name so that their actions will not be duplicated unintentionally
