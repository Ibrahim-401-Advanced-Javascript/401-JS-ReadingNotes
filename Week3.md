##### Authentication
* Router Middleware
  * Middleware functions have access to the request object, response object, and the next middleware function in the web request-response cycle
  * Middleware functions can:
    * execute any code
    * make changes to the request and/or response objects
    * end the request-response cycle
    * call the next middleware function in the stack
  * Express apps can use:
    * application-level middleware - `app.httpmethod(function)` or `app.use(function)`
    * router-level middleware - `const router = express.Router` -> `router.use(function)` or `router.httpmethod(function)`
    * error-handling middleware - `app.use(function(err, req, res, next)`
      * takes four arguments; in addition to req, res, next, we add err
    * built-in middleware
      * `express.static` serves static assets such as HTML files and images
      * `express.json` parses requests with JSON payloads
      * `express.urlencoded` parses incoming requests with url-encoded payloads
    * third-party middleware
      * dependencies that we install with node which add specific functionalities to express applications
* Dynamic Module Loading
  * wrapping imports in async functions
  `async function loadPage() { await import('file/path/filename.js); code to run after completion of import goes here }`
    *[github](https://gist.github.com/Rich-Harris/ea561810900eedd2a8e9afbc78ddd566)
* Singleton Pattern
  * The Singleton Pattern involves a single class responsible for creating an object while ensuring that only a single object gets created
  * The object can be accessed directly without needing to instantiate the object class, as it has been automatically instantiated upon its creation
    * [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/singleton_pattern.htm)
* CRUD -> REST Method Matches
  * Create - POST
  * Read - GET
  * Update - PUT
  * Delete - DELETE
* Mock Testing
  * Mock functions allow us to test code by 'erasing' the actual implementation of the function, instead creating mock situations to base our code connection tests on.

##### OAuth
* Why is authentication important?
  * Protecting a user's private or sensitive information
* Why should we be careful about storing users' passwords?
  * Data breaches occur often, and if we are not careful about the information we store along with encrypted passwords, we could be giving hints to how to easily decrypt them. 
* What is the difference between hashing and encryption?
  * Hashing is a one-way irreversible data conversion using alphanumeric characters to produce a new key, a complex string of letters and numbers
  * Encryption is a secure encoding technique in which data is encoded using an algorithm which only authorized personnel have access to
    * [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/encryption-encoding-hashing/)
* What is the difference between encryption and encoding?
  * Encoding is the reversible process of changing data into a new format 
  * Encryption is a secure encoding technique (see above)
    * [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/encryption-encoding-hashing/)
* What is a token used for?
  * Secure information transmission
  * Persistence of user authorization

##### Vocabulary
* `authentication`
  * the verification of human-server transfer of credentials 
* `authorization`
  * the validation of which functions of an application the user has access to
    * [medium](https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/securing-applications-with-better-user-authorization-625ec07a7001)
* `session`
  * characterized as a temporary interactive information exchange between two web clients, or between a web client and a user
    * [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_(computer_science))
* `cookie`
  * small bits of data stored by browsers which track stateful information (i.e. browsing activity, logins, clicks, shopping carts)
* `token`
  * a complex string of base64 characters which is granted to the user after authentication and authorization
    * [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/introduction/)
* `basic auth`
  * the simplest auth technique, which encodes data with base64
  * generally combined with HTTPS to provide confidentiality of data
    * [swagger.io](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/basic-authentication/)
* `secret`
  * a key used in conjunction with a client id to be used for OAuth
* `cryptography`
  * the study and practice of secure communications techniques which allow only the sender and intended recipient to view sent data
    * [kaspersky](https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-cryptography)

#### Class 13

##### Bearer Authorization
* Write the following steps in the correct order:
  1. Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
  2. Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
  3. Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
  4. Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
  5. Receive authorization code
  6. Make a request to the access token endpoint
  7. Receive access token
* What can you do with an authorization code?
  * Obtain an access token
* What can you do with an access token?
  * Implement single-sign-in functionality & persistent authorization
* Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
  * Single-sign-on systems give the user one less password to worry about managing. Additionally, it grants user more control over their data; they control which applications have what type of access to which type of data.
  
##### Vocabulary
* `Client ID`
   * a public identifier for applications
   * generally not easily guessable
      * [oauth2.0](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/client-registration/client-id-secret/)
* `Client Secret`
   * a string known only to the application & the authorization server
      * [oauth2.0](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/client-registration/client-id-secret/)
* `Authorization Endpoint`
   * a route used to interact with the resource owner and get the authorization to access the secure resource
      * [auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/protocol-oauth2)
* `Access Token Endpoint`
   * a route used by the application in order to get an access token or a refresh token
      * [auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/protocol-oauth2)
* `API Endpoint`
   * a route used as a point of entry when two systems (client-server) are interacting
   * the means from which the API can access the resources they need from a server to perform their task
